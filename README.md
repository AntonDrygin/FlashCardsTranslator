# FlashCardsTranslator

This project is an automated translator for creating flashcards with translations of English words into Russian. It allows foreign language learners to effectively learn new words.

## Main functions

- Reading the list of words from the file 'Vocabulary.txt'. 
(only lines with one word are selected, so this script can be used even for reading articles and books, defining the necessary words by "Enter").
- Filtering and mixing words.
- Breaking words into packages for studying.
- Creating flashcards with translations.
- Displaying translations on the screen with separators between packets.
- Saving translations to text files with unique names.

## Usage

1. Replace the contents of the 'Vocabulary.txt' file with your word list or text to study. 
2. Make sure the words you are interested in are one per line.
3. Run a Python script to create flashcards and output the translations.
4. View the results on the screen and/or locate the flashcards in the 'FlashCardsResalt' directory.
